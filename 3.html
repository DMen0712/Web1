      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script" title="JavaScript specification" target="_blank">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS</a></strong>, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, <br>
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
        <img src="javascript.jpg" width="50%">
        <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, <br>
          dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.</p>
